# "Prework Study Guide Webpage - University BootCamp"

## Description

Creating this webpage was an opportunity to get introduced to three basic coding languages and what they are used for, that is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a newcomer to the tech world and coding, I was excited to create this webpage so that I could have an idea of what to expect once I start the course. I built this project because I wanted to be more informed about what it means to code. This prework study guide will be a good asset at filling gaps in knowledge throughout the course whenever I need to reference anything in regards to the coding languages and Git. I learned that HTML is the foundation for a website, CSS styles the website, and then JavaScript brings it all together by letting other users interact with the website.
